                                    When i have started to practice bodyweight training, this was my first question that i asked. 
                                    My main goal was at that time to lose weight, but i was a little bit sceptic to use only my body. 
                                    After 2 years practicing bodyweight training my simple and short answer is YES. 
                                    You can lose weight VERY FAST and build a LEAN ATHLETIC BODY with bodyweight training.
                                    Today i feel i do not need any equipment anymore, but of course you do not have to forget about the food that you eat.
                                    To lose wait you have to pair your bodyweight training schedule with healthy food. But this is true for any type of training.

                                    YES! And you will be surprised how fast and how big. Probably you are wondering how you can stimulate your muscles after a while when you reached your goal. In a Gym it is very simple. Just simply drop more weigths on the Barbel or just simply pick up a heavier dumble.
                                    Well, with bodyweight training it is probably not that simple, but possible. Take the simpliest examples: push up, pull up, chin up.
                                    If you can make 15 push ups, you can go to the next level. Do 15 ELEVATED push ups Simple change the position of your body. This time you change the angle of your body and with this the load of your upper body. If you start as a beginner (as i did/do) still much better to make the foundations with these basic movements and exercises. 
                                    To make them correctly you have to go through a progress. By following that you will have functional strength.

                                    Absolutely Yes! Even if you are a beginner you already know how to perform correctly the most common basic bodyweight exercises (push up, squats, lunge, sit up, crunches ...). 
                                    But if you do not have memories from your elementary schools, still you can find a lot of tutorial videos aor guiding posters on the net.

                                    Not an easy question.There are several factors which have effect. How many times do you train? How hard you train? Do you follow any diet together with your training?
                                    I cannot promis that you will see results within one week, but what i can promise you if you train consistently, you will gain self-confidence. Even you do not see any result in the mirror,
                                    but you will feel leaner, stronger and more determined. Do not forget that the weight is not everything. You are going to gain muscle, not only burning fat ... and the muscle is denser, heavier than the fat ...

                                    Up to you. Depends on your activity and fitness level. If you are just the beginning at your journey i suggest do not make more than 3 trainings a week. Just to make sure that you train consistently and enjoy the training. 
                                    If you do like that as your fitness level will increase you will increase the number of your trainings. I train 5 days a week. I do not believe you have to do more until you are not a professionbal sportman. 
                                    it is better to decide for a fewer training per week and do them all, then decide too much and always skip ... This would have a huge effect on your self-confidence.
